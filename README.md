This Repository contains Digital electronics circuits Simulated in Logic Circuit Simulator Pro application.          
       ***74 Series IC file contains The Dual in line 14 pin IC's.***
***Note:*** In practical, the ICs which we have choosen contains +Vcc(Supply pin at pin-14) and Grd(Ground at Pin-7) but in the application we don't require any kind of external supply or Ground, so we have neglected the pin number **7** and **14**.
